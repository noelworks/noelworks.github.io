				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<p>
					Designing for people, not just pixels — I’m a UX design student exploring how stories,
					systems, and empathy shape better digital worlds.
				</p>
				<p>
					So far, I’ve worked with a startup to design NonVegMart, a food delivery platform, and
					built a range of projects during my coursework — from secure photo vaults and tourism
					redesigns to data visualisations and service design for student salons. I also love
					experimenting with visual storytelling through illustrations, photography, and graphic
					design.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of design, you’ll often find me on the football field, chasing sunsets, or getting
					involved in community work. I’ve served as the youth president of my church and enjoy
					being part of spaces that bring people together — on and off the screen.
